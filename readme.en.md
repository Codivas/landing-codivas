Collaborative repository for responsive development of Colivas Codivas landing page.


We are a collective for freelance services or PJ for developer people. We give priority to women's empowerment, regardless of any race, nationality or gender. We seek horizontalization within all projects within the collective, without high positions or unequal salaries.

We were born with the objective of taking opportunities for Cis or Trans women, who wish to work with technology in an environment of respect, sorority, sincerity, and mutual learning.

We need to build a single page website to attract new customers and new professionals. Do you feel you can help us? Please see if you can help with any of our issues or call us at collectivocodivas@gmail.com. instagram.com/co.divas

## How to collaborate?

- Choose an Issue and submit your change by pull-request ;)

Suggestion for commits:

- Put the issue number that you changed, at the beginning of the commit. example #123: I changed the color of the h2

We will receive your suggestion for improvement in the code, being all right, we will give the merge to the master and insert your name as a project collaborator.

LET'S GO TOGETHER!
